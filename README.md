# CST8917 Lab 1: Building Azure Function Apps with Output Bindings

## Objective

In this lab, you will develop two serverless Azure Function apps using **Python** and **Visual Studio Code**. You'll implement **output bindings** to connect your functions with Azure **Storage Queues** and **Azure SQL Database**.

You will complete the following official Microsoft QuickStart tutorials:

ðŸ”— [Add an Azure Storage Queue output binding to a function in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python&tabs=isolated-process)  
ðŸ”— [Add an Azure SQL output binding to a function in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-azure-sql-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python)

By the end of this lab, you should understand how to configure output bindings and deploy function apps that push data to external services.

## About Azure Functions and Output Bindings

### What Are Azure Functions?

**Azure Functions** is a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-driven code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Functions are triggered by events such as HTTP requests, queue messages, or database changes.

### What Are Output Bindings?

**Output bindings** simplify the way your functions interact with other Azure services by abstracting the logic required to connect and send data. This lets you focus on your appâ€™s logic rather than service integration code.

For example, an output binding can:
- Send a message to a queue
- Write a record to a database
- Save a file to blob storage

## Tasks

### 1. Follow the Storage Queue Binding Tutorial

- Complete all steps from the [Storage Queue output binding QuickStart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python&tabs=isolated-process).
- Use Python as your programming language and VS Code as your development environment.
- Test the function locally and deploy it to Azure.
- Confirm that queue messages are added correctly when the function is triggered.

### 2. Follow the Azure SQL Binding Tutorial

- Complete all steps from the [Azure SQL output binding QuickStart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-azure-sql-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python).
- Again, use Python and VS Code.
- Make sure to set up the Azure SQL Database and table schema as instructed.
- Verify that your function inserts records into the database successfully.

### 3. Documentation

Include a `README.md` with the following:

- Setup instructions for both functions, including any Azure resources you created (queues, databases).
- Steps to run and test the functions locally.
- A **5-minute demo video** showing:
  - Your function in action (queue message or database insert)
  - A quick walkthrough of your code and what you learned

### 5. GitHub Repository

- Use Git to track your work.
- Make **frequent, descriptive commits**.
- Push your project to a **public GitHub repository**.
- Include your **YouTube demo link in the README.md**.

## Submission Instructions

Submit your **GitHub repository link** via Brightspace.

**Deadline**: Thursday, 29 May 2025

## Tips

- Read each tutorial carefully and do not skip setup steps.
- Validate your code by reviewing the Azure Portal to confirm successful execution and output (queue or database).
- Ask for help early if you get stuck.
